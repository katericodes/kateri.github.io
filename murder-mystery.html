										<h1>SQL Murder Mystery</h1>
									</header>

									<p> The SQL Murder Mystery is a web-based SQL challenge designed by two MIT students, Joon Park and Cathy He. It can be found on <a href= "https://mystery.knightlab.com/">mystery.knightlab.com.</a></p>
									<p>The following SQL concepts were used to solve the mystery:</p>
                                    <ul> 
                                        <li>LIKE and Wildcards (%)</li>
										<li>IN</li>
										<li>GROUP BY</li>
                                        <li>ORDER BY</li>
                                        <li>JOINS</li>
                                        <li>LIMIT</li>
                                    </ul>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>The Challenge</h2>
									<p>A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.
									</p>
									<h3>The Schema</h3>

									<h2>Finding Witness Reports</h2>
									<p>Based on the given challenge, we're looking for a crime report for a murder that happened on Jan. 15, 2018 in SQL City.</p>
									<pre><code>select *

									<p>Based on the report, we are looking for two witnesses.</p>

									<p>From the witness reports, we are looking for a suspect who fits the following criteria:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The suspect is a man.</li>
										<li>The suspect is a member of "Get Fit Now Gym" with an ID that starts with "48Z."</li>
										<li>The suspect is a "gold" member.</li>
										<li>The suspect was in the gym on January 9th (2018).</li>
										<li>The suspect drives a car with a license plate containging "H42W"</li>

									<h2>Searching for Suspects</h2>
									<p>Based on the given clues, it should be enough to narrow down the suspects based on the gym membership ID, the check-in date, and the license plate.</p>
									<pre><code>select get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id,

									<h2>Determining the Killer</h2>
									<p>We narrowed down the suspects to Jeremy Bowers. We'll check if he's the killer by inserting his name into the provided query.</p>
									<pre><code>INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
SELECT value FROM solution;</code></pre>
										<blockquote>Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.</blockquote>
									<h2>Follow Up Challenge: Finding the Mastermind</h2>

									<h3>Determining the Mastermind</h3>
									<p>The above queries lead to Miranda Priestly being the mastermind. By checking her name in the provided query, we get the following:</p>
									<pre><code>INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
